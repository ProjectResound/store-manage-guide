# How do I delete audio?

### From the audio page:

Click on** Delete this file**.![](/assets/Screen Shot 2017-09-26 at 10.15.02 AM.png)A warning box comes up.  Deleting the audio not only deletes it from Resound Store, but also deletes the listed files from the server so that any sites or feeds that use those audio links will no longer be able to access those audio files.
