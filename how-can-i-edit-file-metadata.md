# How can I edit file metadata?

### From the audio page:

Click the **Edit File** button.![](/assets/Screen Shot 2017-09-26 at 10.05.39 AM.png)

The metadata fields that can be modified have a blue border around them.  Type in the changes and then click on **Save Changes** to confirm the changes.

Changes to the _Title_ and _Contributors_ field will propagate to the file's encoded metadata so that when you edit the file using audio editing software, the software will be able to read those values.
