Click on **Edit File** to go into _editing mode_.

Click on the **Replace audio** button on top of the wave form to activate the file picker.

Drag and drop your .wav audio into the space on top of **Drag & drop your new audio here** OR

Click the teal button to browser for your audio using the file picker.

Click on **Upload this file** to start the upload.

The progress bar will proceed to 100% and then start transcoding the audio.  After a few minutes, the audio waveform will load the new audio and you will see a success message like this:![](/assets/Screen Shot 2017-09-26 at 10.04.57 AM.png)



If you drop in new audio and a message saying that a file already exists with that filename appears, it is because someone has already uploaded the same audio to the server:![](/assets/Screen Shot 2017-09-26 at 10.05.39 AM.png)

Resound prevents you from uploading two audios with the same file name \(ie: _Crash-Cymbal-4.wav_\). Your options are either to go to **Other audio page**, or rename the audio to a different file name try again by clicking **Upload a different file**.
