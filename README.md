# Resound Store/Manage

The Store/Manage app allows users to upload audio files to a central place and keep track of these files through tagging.  Once the WAV audio file is uploaded, the app will transcode that file to other formats.

Supported formats:

* [FLAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC) \(.flac\) -- mainly used for storing a high fidelity version of the file without using up a lot of storage space.
* MP3 \(.mp3\) -- a widely sharable format
* [HE-AAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Efficiency_Advanced_Audio_Coding) \(.m4a\) -- optimized for low bandwidth use \(streaming\)
